Markee
============

This is a simple bookmarking application powered by Rails 5 and MaterializeCSS that provides the main functions you'd expect from a bookmarking app, such as storing, categorizing and sharing links, etc. I built this simple
web app to practice and implement what I have learned from Ruby on Rails 5 course on Udemy.
